# NeuroWing: AI-Powered Discovery of Pre-Columbian Archaeological Sites in the Amazon Basin

## A Dual-Gate Archaeological Intelligence System Using Satellite Imagery, Environmental ML, and Multi-Model AI Validation

---

## üåü Introduction

### The Problem
The Amazon rainforest conceals thousands of undiscovered pre-Columbian archaeological sites, many at risk from deforestation and development. Recent LiDAR surveys have revealed spectacular discoveries like the Casarabe culture's monumental architecture, but systematic survey across the 6.7 million km¬≤ Amazon basin remains impractical with traditional methods.

### Why This Matters
- **Cultural Heritage at Risk**: Deforestation destroys archaeological sites before they can be documented
- **Lost History**: Entire civilizations remain hidden beneath the forest canopy
- **Scientific Opportunity**: AI can systematically identify sites for priority conservation and study
- **Indigenous Knowledge**: Early site identification enables proper consultation with indigenous communities

### This Solution
**I developed NeuroWing as a dual-gate archaeological discovery system that combines peer-reviewed environmental predictors with AI-powered shape detection to systematically identify potential archaeological sites with quantified confidence scores. The system is designed with an extensible architecture to eventually integrate all available archaeological data sources‚Äîfrom satellite imagery and LiDAR to historical documents, soil analysis, and cultural databases‚Äîleveraging the full spectrum of AI technologies including computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning to create a comprehensive archaeological intelligence platform. My vision is to harness every technological advancement our era has to offer in service of a deeply human purpose: to trace the fading footprints of our ancestors, to give voice to civilizations lost beneath time and forest, and to ensure that the stories of those who came before us are not forgotten in an age of rapid change.**

## üî¨ Methodology

### Core System Architecture

The dual-gate approach validates potential sites through two independent evidence streams:

#### Gate 1: Walker Environmental Predictors
- **Foundation**: Walker et al. (2023) PeerJ machine learning methodology
- **Threshold**: ‚â•0.45 environmental suitability score
- **Weighted Factors**:
  - Soil cation concentration (30% weight)
  - Terrain position index (25% weight)  
  - Height above drainage (20% weight)
  - Distance to rivers (15% weight)
  - Elevation optimization (10% weight)

#### Gate 2: AI Shape Detection Ensemble
- **Multi-Model Architecture**: YOLO + SAM + Vision Transformer (ResNet-50)
- **Threshold**: ‚â•0.45 AI confidence for archaeological shapes
- **Input**: 224√ó224 pixel Sentinel-2 satellite patches
- **Processing**: Real-time patch download and analysis

### Data Sources & APIs
- **Google Earth Engine**: Primary data platform
  - Sentinel-2 (COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED) - 10m multispectral imagery
  - SRTM (USGS/SRTMGL1_003) - 30m digital elevation model
  - SoilGrids (projects/soilgrids-isric/) - 250m soil properties
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Archaeological context validation and interpretation
- **Python Stack**: pandas, geopandas, scikit-learn, folium, cv2, torch
- **Custom Tools**: LZ4-compressed caching, parallel batch processing

### Target Region Selection
- **Scientific Approach**: Gap analysis based on published archaeological distributions
- **Grid System**: 3km systematic spacing for comprehensive coverage
- **Priority Regions**: Extensions of documented cultural areas (Casarabe, Geoglyph builders, Upper Xingu, Tapaj√≥s)

### Site Validation Process
I implemented a systematic validation workflow:
1. **Grid Coordinate Generation**: Systematic 3km spacing across target regions
2. **Environmental Screening**: Walker predictor calculation per coordinate
3. **Satellite Acquisition**: Real-time Sentinel-2 patch download (session: 20250629_181554)
4. **AI Analysis**: Multi-model ensemble shape detection
5. **Dual-Gate Filtering**: Sites must exceed both 0.45 thresholds
6. **Confidence Scoring**: Quantified assessment for research prioritization
